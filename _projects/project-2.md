## **📖 Project Overview**

### **Objective**
Our primary goal is to develop an efficient algorithm for the "Totally-Looks-Like" challenge, aiming to match similar looking images from a dataset.

### **Description**

We've embarked on this journey to craft an algorithm that can adeptly match an image from a "Totally-Looks-Like" pair with its counterpart from a myriad of potential matches. Our journey is deeply rooted in critical analysis and rigorous evaluation using the dataset provided. The outcomes will be gauged through error analysis, unveiling the robustness and fragility of our approach.
